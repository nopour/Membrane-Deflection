> [!TIP]
> In this project deflection of an elastic membrane is investigated using the Finite Element Method (FEM). In the beginning, the generalities and importance of the membrane and equations governing the problem, as well as the description of the solution method and algorithm are given. To validate the C++ code written in this project, MATLAB is used.
